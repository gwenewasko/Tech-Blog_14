# 14 Model-View-Controller (MVC): Tech Blog

## Description:

My MVC Tech Blog is an application where authenticated users can post, delete and add comments to blog posts.

When a user comes to my website, they are prompted to either sign up, or sign in.

Once they are signed in, they are directed to thier dashboard where they can see a list of thier existing blogs, and also where they can add a new blog.

If they add a new blog, it is added to the list of "Current Blogs" on the right hand side, which is also where the blogs can be deleted.

When the user navigates to the home page, they can see a list of all the blog posts that all users have added.

When a user clicks on a blog post, at the bottom of the post they can add a comment to the post. When they click "Post Comment", their comment populates at the bottom of the post.
